Lindsay’s Classroom PictoTimer
Lindsay is a special education teacher for students aged 18-21 with developmental disabilities who require extensive support needs to function in daily life. Lindsay’s students require tremendous amounts of verbal prompting to transition between activities, classes, and daily living tasks inside and outside of class, but respond very well to technology and love routine. 
Lindsay would like to promote independence through automating the verbal prompts. To accomplish this, she would like each student to have a programmed timer on their device that displays a photo that signals the next activity to the student. 
Teachers and students would have their own accounts and logins with different privileges. Each teacher would be able to manage their classes and individual students by programming the timers for them.
Problem - Verbal prompts require much effort from the teacher, and reduce student independence. The PictoTimer will automate the verbal prompts. 
Stakeholder - Lindsay Bogovich, Special Education Teacher.  
Lindsay will have the role of the customer, she will be readily available for us. Lindsay’s responsibility is to define our requirements for her program, and to be available to check in with us to be sure we are achieving her requirements. 

Secondary Stakeholders - Students, other teachers, parents of students.
Students, their parents, and other teachers have a vested interest in student independence and academic success;  some requirements for PictoTimer may indirectly be defined by secondary stakeholders. 

Critical Quality Concern - One critical quality concern that cannot be solved by a COTS product is the integration between the timer, image hosting, and the programming of the student’s schedule of verbal prompts.

Key Objective/Idea - Automating verbal prompts using a  programmable timer and an image will reduce the workload of the organization, the teachers, and will promote independence and ease of life for the end-users,  the students. 

Scope- A programmable timer, image uploading, and accounts with different privileges. Users will be able to login, view classrooms which will contain student accounts, program student accounts to have images  appear when the timer reaches a certain time. The scope also includes the constraints

Size - Medium-sized. 

Key Constraints -
Project design must be completed by end of quarter
Lindsay must be available
Unforeseen additional requirements from Lindsay
Cost, time, scope (triple constraints of project management)

Technologies - 
Languages/tools  - JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, React, Microsoft VS
Platforms - Web App*, Desktop App(Windows, Mac OS)?, Mobile         App(Android, IOS)?


Feasibility - Based on the scope and constraints, we believe this project to be feasible. 
We will focus on the project to only satisfy the Web App requirement until we know if we have time to adjust for different platforms.
